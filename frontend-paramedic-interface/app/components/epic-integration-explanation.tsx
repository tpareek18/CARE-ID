// This is an explanation file, not actual code

// The Epic integration works through the following components and flows:

// 1. Authentication Flow:
// - The EpicIntegration component includes a secure authentication dialog
// - Users enter their Epic credentials (username, password, and auth code)
// - In a real implementation, this would use OAuth 2.0 or SMART on FHIR protocols
// - For demo purposes, we're using a simple auth code ("1234")

// 2. Data Retrieval:
// - After authentication, the component would connect to Epic's API endpoints
// - It would use FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard
// - The component would request patient data using the patient's identifiers
// - Data categories include: recent visits, labs, medications, and clinical notes

// 3. Data Display:
// - The retrieved data is organized into tabs for easy navigation
// - Each data type has specialized formatting for clinical relevance
// - Abnormal values are highlighted with visual indicators

// 4. Integration with CareID:
// - The "Import to Current Record" button allows merging Epic data with CareID
// - This creates a comprehensive patient record combining emergency info with history

// 5. Security Considerations:
// - In production, this would use:
//   - HTTPS for all communications
//   - OAuth 2.0 for authentication
//   - SMART on FHIR for authorization
//   - Audit logging for all data access
//   - Timeout sessions for security

// Note: In a real implementation, you would need:
// - Epic developer account and API access
// - FHIR API endpoints for your specific Epic instance
// - Proper credentials and certificates
// - Compliance with HIPAA and other healthcare regulations
